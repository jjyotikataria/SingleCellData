The Blueprint/ENCODE reference consists of bulk RNA-seq data for pure stroma and immune cells generated by Blueprint (Martens and Stunnenberg 2013) and ENCODE projects (The ENCODE Project Consortium 2012).

This reference consists of a collection of mouse bulk RNA-seq data sets downloaded from the gene expression omnibus (Benayoun et al. 2019). A variety of cell types are available, again mostly from blood but also covering several other tissues.


The ImmGen reference consists of microarray profiles of pure mouse immune cells from the project of the same name (Heng et al. 2008). This is currently the most highly resolved immune reference - possibly overwhelmingly so, given the granularity of the fine labels.

The DICE reference consists of bulk RNA-seq samples of sorted cell populations from the project of the same name (Schmiedel et al. 2018).


The Novershtern reference (previously known as Differentiation Map) consists of microarray datasets for sorted hematopoietic cell populations from GSE24759 (Novershtern et al. 2011).

The Monaco reference consists of bulk RNA-seq samples of sorted immune cell populations from GSE107011 (Monaco et al. 2019).
